I have been giving some talks recently on various topics related to
JavaScript, mostly centered around ReactJS and EcmaScript.

Here is a list of those recent videos:

[Standing on the Shoulders of Giants or How to Read the Internals of React.js](https://vimeo.com/129469530)

I gave this talk at AtTheFrontend conference in Denmark in May 2015.

[Introduction to ReactJS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSeurgO39Hk)

[Introduction to EcmaScript 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlrirWY9JTk)

I gave these talks in meetup groups in Barcelona in March 2015.

[Taming Complexity with Django and React.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6QAD0aLt0)

This talk was in Djangocon Europe 2014 in May 2014.

Stay tuned,
